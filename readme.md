# TechHub 2024 Challenges Solution

This project contains my solutions to the TechHub 2024 challenges, an event hosted by the IGEnergy Club.

## Event Details

- **Description:** Annual Problem Solving Competion Using Programming
- **Date:** 23rd November 2024
- **Location:** National Higher School of Telecommunications and ICT - Oran

## Contents

- **Challenge 1: (Meeting Rooms)**
Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times [[s1, e1], [s2,
e2], ...], determine if a person can attend all meetings.
Example:
Input: [[0, 30], [5, 10], [15, 20]]
Output: false


- **Challenge 2: (Merge Two Sorted Arrays)**
Given two sorted arrays, merge them into a single sorted array.
Example:
Input: arr1 = [1, 3, 5], arr2 = [2, 4, 6]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]


- **Challenge 3: (Sorting by Frequency)**
Sort an array based on the frequency of elements. If two elements have the same
frequency, sort them in ascending order.
Example:
Input: [4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 3]
Output: [3, 6, 4, 4, 5, 5]


- **Challenge 4: (Valid Parentheses)**
Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[', and ']', determine if the input
string is valid (i.e., brackets close properly).
Example:
Input: s = "()"
Output: true
Input: s = "(]"
Output: false
Hint: Use a stack.


- **Challenge 5: (Remove Duplicates from a Sorted Linked List)**
Remove all duplicate elements from a sorted linked list.
Example:
Input: 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3 -> NULL
Output: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> NULL

- **Challenge 6: (Guess the Hidden World)**
Create a program that asks the user to input a word. The program hides the
letters of this word with * and displays:
1. The hidden word.
2. The letters revealed with each correct guess by the user.
Example:
If the word is LEMON, the program first displays *****. With each correct guess, the
revealed letters are shown.
